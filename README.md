# Clone-all-repos script generator

Generates a script for backing up all your GitHub repos. Clunky, but it works. I've only used the generated shell script on Ubuntu. YMMV on Mac. Not for Windows.

## Usage

Use it at [arthurattwell.github.io/repo-backup-script-generator/](https://arthurattwell.github.io/repo-backup-script-generator/), where there are more instructions.

## Development

In a local copy of this folder, run `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000` to serve the page at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/), or use `http-server` with Node.
